    "본 프로젝트를 통해 선박 도장 이미지 데이터를 분석하고, VGG16과 LightGBM 모델을 활용하여 약 96.7%의 정확도로 도장 품질을 분류하는 모델을 성공적으로 구축했습니다. 이를 통해 기존 수작업 검사 방식의 비효율성을 개선할 수 있는 자동화의 가능성을 확인했습니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 어려웠던 점 및 해결 과정\n",
    "- **어려웠던 점:** 정확도와 과적합 사이의 딜레마  \n",
    "    모델 학습 초기, 간단한 모델을 사용했을 때는 성능이 너무 낮고, 반대로 복잡한 모델을 사용해 학습 데이터에 대한 정확도를 높였더니 검증 데이터에서 성능이 떨어지는 전형적인 과적합 현상이 발생했습니다. 단순히 한 모델의 파라미터를 조정하는 것만으로는 두 문제를 동시에 해결하기 어려운 딜레마에 부딪혔습니다.\n",
    "- **해결 과정:** 체계적인 모델 비교를 통한 최적 모델 선정  \n",
    "    이러한 트레이드오프 관계를 해결하기 위해, 접근 방식을 '하나의 모델 최적화'에서 '주어진 문제에 가장 적합한 모델을 찾는 과정'으로 변경했습니다. VGG16으로 추출한 특징 벡터를 가지고 로지스틱 회귀, 랜덤 포레스트 등 여러 모델을 테스트했습니다.\n",
    "    그 결과, 복잡도는 유지하면서도 뛰어난 규제 기능으로 과적합을 억제하는 LightGBM 모델이 데이터셋에 가장 적합하다고 판단했습니다. 최종적으로 LightGBM을 채택하여 과적합을 방지하면서도 96.7%라는 높은 검증 정확도를 달성할 수 있었습니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 배운 점 및 향후 개선 방안\n",
    "- **배운 점:** 균형 잡힌 모델 평가와 유연한 사고의 중요성  \n",
    "    이번 프로젝트를 통해 좋은 모델이란 단순히 정확도만 높은 모델이 아니라, 과적합 등 다양한 요소를 종합적으로 고려하여 균형을 맞추는 것이 중요함을 깨달았습니다. 또한, 하나의 접근 방식이 막혔을 때 다양한 모델을 비교하고 탐색하는 유연한 문제 해결 방식이 어떻게 더 좋은 결과로 이어질 수 있는지 체감할 수 있었습니다.\n",
    "- **개선 방안:** 미세 조정을 통한 성능 극대화  \n",
    "    현재는 VGG16 모델을 고정된 특징 추출기로만 사용하여 좋은 성능을 얻었지만, 여기서 더 나아가 모델의 일부 레이어까지 재학습시키는 미세 조정 기법을 적용한다면, 데이터셋의 특징을 더 깊이 학습하여 정확도를 한계까지 끌어올릴 수 있지 않았을까 라는 생각이 듭니다."
